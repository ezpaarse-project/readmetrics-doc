## What is ReadMETRICS ?

**ReadMETRICS** is a new turnkey solution for :

- monitoring transformative agreements, including before and beyond
- analyzing usage across disciplines and consortia
- assessing value of publishing spend
- enabling comparative citation analysis

It is based on the already existing and field-tested [ezPAARSE](https://www.ezpaarse.org/) and [ezMESURE](https://ezmesure.couperin.org/) Free and Open Source tools, extending and including features inspired by the [National Library of Luxembourg](https://bnl.public.lu/fr.html)’s transition to Open Access, described [here](https://www.consortium.lu/?page_id=6334).

## Timeline

We are working to make the readMetrics stack **available by Summer 2021**. In the meantime the tools that constitute the stack are already available and can be deployed and used by interested pilot sites. Please do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:readmetrics@couperin.org) directly!

## Financing the Team and the Tools

The team currently includes 6 people, financially supported by Inist-CNRS and the consortium Couperin.org with more occasional help from third-party structures (BnL and OCLC). Among the institutions that are willing to use the readMETRICS solution, we are looking for partners willing to participate financially, to help us finance two of the current developer jobs and continue to maintain existing tools and offer new functionalities. The amount we have to reach is roughly 90k€ (or 100k$) per year.

## What is ezPAARSE

An [open-source software](https://github.com/ezpaarse-project/ezpaarse/) that can ingest your (proxy) log files and show how users access subscribed electronic resources. It filters, extracts and enriches the access events that were spotted and produces a result file that ezMESURE can ingest and display in a dashboard.

## What is ezMESURE

An [open-source software](https://github.com/ezpaarse-project/ezmesure/) built upon [Elastic and Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/fr/) to assemble a repository centralizing the usage statistics data produced by one or many instances of ezPAARSE. It is also able to ingest [COUNTER5](https://www.projectcounter.org/code-of-practice-five-sections/abstract/) data.
